# Wi-Fi Security Lab with ESP8266 Deauther

This project documents my hands-on wireless security lab using an ESP8266 devboard running Spacehuhn's Deauther firmware. The goal was to explore Wi-Fi attacks and defenses in a safe, isolated environment for cybersecurity learning.

## Tools Used
- ESP8266 NodeMCU Devboard (4MB)
- Deauther firmware (v3.0.0+)
- Isolated guest Wi-Fi network
- Kali Linux (for future wireless packet analysis)
- VirtualBox + test VMs

## Lab Goals
- Learn about deauthentication attacks
- Explore SSID spoofing & beacon spam
- Identify MAC address behavior and randomization
- Test basic Wi-Fi hardening measures

## Progress
- [x] Setup ESP8266 Deauther
- [x] Created isolated Wi-Fi lab
- [x] Ran client-targeted deauth attacks
- [x] Observed SSID beacon spamming
- [ ] Monitor mode sniffing with Kali (coming soon)
