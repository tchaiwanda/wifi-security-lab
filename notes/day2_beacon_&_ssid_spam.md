## Day 2 - Beacon & SSID Spam with ESP8266

### Goals
- Understand 802.11 beacon frames
- Create and broadcast fake SSIDs (Wi-Fi spam)
- Observe how nearby devices respond to fake networks
- Practice ethical boundaries in wireless testing

### Steps Completed
1. Connected to ESP8266 via pwned/Deauther hotspot
2. Navigated to the SSID tab in Web UI
3. Created a list of fake SSIDs
4. Started a beacon spam test in an isolated lab environment
5. Observed mobile phone behavior


### Key Concepts
- Beacon frame broadcasting
- SSID spoofing for awareness/demo
- Wireless clutter as a DoS vector
- Legal limitations of wireless spam outside of lab conditions

> All testing was performed in a lab with isolated devices and no disruption to public networks.
